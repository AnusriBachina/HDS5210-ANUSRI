It offered a comprehensive perspective on data integration and visualization techniques that aligned well with my goals. The links provided were clear, although I didn’t check their functionality in this session. Its responses were logical, clear, and easy to understand. I appreciated how it tailored recommendations to my project needs and offered practical advice for enhancing my analysis. However, I’d like to explore its coding capabilities next—maybe it can help with data preprocessing or visualization scripts."
